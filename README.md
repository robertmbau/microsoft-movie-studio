IMDB (https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/)
Rotten Tomatoes (https://www.rottentomatoes.com)
The Movie Database (https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US)

For the data imdb_movies.tsv, it can be found here: movie_basics (https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.basics.tsv.gz) . Download, extract and rename to imdb_movies.

Create a folder .data and copy all the data files to that folder.

This analysis leads to the following recommendations for Microsoft Movie Studio:

- **A movie studio is a viable business opportunity.** The movie industry seems to be growing steadily and apart from the Covid-19 induced shutdown, it has grown almost every year.
- **Budget plays a crucial role in the success of the studio.** The budget is one of the most important aspects of a studio. It seems to influence whether a movie is successful in the box office. It also helps in hiring top talent.
- **Adopt movies that are to the liking of the audience** Top rated movies are grossing very high because they have a large audience. Producing according to the audience ratings and genres will help the studio suceed.
